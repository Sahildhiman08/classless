If you can easily and completely control the HTML structure of your site, this just be pretty straightforward:

1. Write or generate HTML [with this structure](https://github.com/fiatjaf/classless/blob/master/explained-structure.html) (see [this](/for-cms-makers) for a brief explanation).
2. Choose a theme [on the theme gallery](https://classless.alhur.es/themes) and include the URL given there on a `<link ref="stylesheet" href="{url-here}">` element inside the `<head>`.
3. That's it.

If cannot easily control your website's HTML (for example, you're using a Wordpress server with a lot of files and moving parts), move to [something](https://github.com/fiatjaf/sitio) [else](https://github.com/onli/ursprung) or use a [hosted service that supports classless by default](https://sitios.xyz/)!
