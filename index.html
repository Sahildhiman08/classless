    <p>CSS Zen Garden for standard blog-like HTML</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <article>
      <p>Classless is a collection of themes for blog and blog-like websites (any webpage that follows the simple CMS content organization: pages/posts, sections/categories listing these pages/posts, a navigation menu everywhere etc.) based on pure semantic HTML.</p>
      <p>All themes follow the same HTML structure, so you can just swap the CSS (sometimes JS) and you get a whole new theme without having to change anything. The HTML consists of only tags, no classes or ids, and makes very little assumptions about the content with which you will fill it.</p>
      <p>If you haven't already, stop reading this and go play with the bizarre widget that is floating at the right of your screen. Choose a theme and see how this page goes with it, or choose a different HTML structure and explore the themes (this page does not implement some elements of the standard HTML, such as navs, footers and asides, also it doesn't have a "list of posts").</p>
      <h1>The basic HTML template</h1>
      <p>Because the HTML5 standard doesn't define which elements should come first, I had to pick an order and stick with it:</p>
      <p><iframe src="https://workflowy.com/s/Q79FgxLKUT" style="width: 100%; height: 600px;"></iframe></p>
      <p>See this HTML structure in <a href="https://github.com/websitesfortrello/classless/blob/gh-pages/template.html">HTML source</a> or in <a href="https://workflowy.com/s/Q79FgxLKUT">a Workflowy scheme</a>.</p>
      <h1>For theme writers</h1>
      <p>Write your theme once, constrain yourself a little to the limited space for customization of the HTML, but magically you get compatibility with all CMSes out there.</p>
      <p>Perhaps, however, for doing extra nice stuff you'll need to use <a href="http://www.heydonworks.com/article/tetris-the-power-of-css">tricky CSS</a>, which is where the fun begins, I presume.</p>
      <h1>For CMS builders</h1>
      <p>If you're writing a CMS, be it a hosted service with a specific usage or an open-source Wordpress alternative you don't need to think about themes (and all the network effect arising from it: people use if we have beautiful themes, theme builders come if we have a users) or <a href="https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/issues/56">try to be compatible with other CMSes</a> to use themes designed for them specifically. You can just be compatible with <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/18/the-importance-of-sections/">HTML5sectioning elements</a> and comply to this minimal standard I've come up with and you'll get automatically our pure CSS (and JS sometimes) open source themes.</p>
      <p>You also free yourself from the burden of writing a mechanism that allow theme builders to write HTML, share it (maybe even have a "theme market") and get that HTML rendered by your software, you can accept just CSS and JS, which can be just appended to the rendered page and that's it.</p>
      <h1>Contribute!</h1>
      <p>As you can see, I'm not the best designer in the world, and all these themes are ports from random themes open-sourced on the web, so any help with theme creation and <b>suggestions for improvements</b> in the basic template will be very much appreciated.</p>
      <p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/websitesfortrello/classless">GitHub repository</a> with more information, the basic template and all themes, and a <a href="http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/classless/playground/">playground for dinamically testing themes</a> with somewhat-random generated HTML (remember that these random pages aren't supposed to be pretty, they're just visualization helpers). And just in case you're thinking this is a crazy new idea, well, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/19/classes-where-were-going-we-dont-need-classes/">I wasn't the first to think about it</a>.</p>
      <h1>Live</h1>
      <p>Classless themes are currently being used in the following places on the internet:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/">My own Jekyll-based website</a> uses the <a href="https://github.com/websitesfortrello/classless/tree/gh-pages/themes/jeen">jeen theme</a>.</li>
        <li>Websites generated at <a href="http://websitesfortrello.com/">Websites for Trello</a> use classless HTML and themes as it main <i>theme engine</i>, if we can call it by that name.</li>
        <li><a href="http://cards.websitesfortrello.com/">Card sharing for Trello</a> follows with static Trello card hosting using the <a href="https://github.com/websitesfortrello/classless/tree/gh-pages/themes/wardrobe">wardrobe theme</a>.</li>
      </ul>
