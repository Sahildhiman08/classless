A badly-written little post about the motivation of this work: http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/programming/reusable-pure-css-themes/

A prototype of a _playground environment_ for testing themes: http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/unitemplate/playground

  * use the almost-random HTML that is loaded, or click on the buttons to get real-world _unitemplated_ HTML.
  * write the name of a theme in our [themes](https://github.com/fiatjaf/unitemplate/tree/gh-pages/themes) directory to test it, or paste the URL of CSS theme (it can be from GitHub).

## Who uses this?

* [my own website](http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/) uses a selected extract of the HTML structure described in [unitemplate.html](https://github.com/fiatjaf/unitemplate/tree/gh-pages/unitemplate.html) and a custom personal simple theme (at [http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/site.css](http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/site.css)).
* Websites generated by [Websites for Trello](http://websitesfortrello.com/) comply to the HTML structure described in [unitemplate.html](https://github.com/fiatjaf/unitemplate/tree/gh-pages/unitemplate.html) and suggests the themes in [themes](https://github.com/fiatjaf/unitemplate/tree/gh-pages/themes) to its users, also allowing them to create their own (css-only) themes.
* Trello cards published under http://cards.websitesfortrello.com/ uses a small excerpt of [unitemplate.html](https://github.com/fiatjaf/unitemplate/tree/gh-pages/unitemplate.html) and the [wardrobe theme](https://github.com/fiatjaf/unitemplate/blob/gh-pages/themes/wardrobe.css).
