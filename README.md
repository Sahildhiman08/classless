* A badly-written little post about the motivation of this work: http://fiatjaf.github.io/programming/reusable-pure-css-themes/
* The best way to understand the HTML structure of the standard classless template: https://workflowy.com/s/Q79FgxLKUT
* A [playground](https://fiatjaf.github.io/classless/playground/) for testing themes:

  * use the almost-random HTML that is loaded, or click on the buttons to get real-world _classlessd_ HTML.
  * write the name of a theme in our [themes](themes) directory to test it, or paste the URL of CSS theme (it can be from GitHub).

## Is this being used somewhere?

* Websites generated by [Websites for Trello](http://websitesfortrello.com/) comply to the HTML structure described in [classless.html](template.html) and suggests the themes in [themes](themes) to its users, also allowing them to use their own (css and js only) themes.
