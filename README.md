* [Our home page and demo](http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/classless/)
* A badly-written little post about the motivation of this work: http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/programming/reusable-pure-css-themes/
* The best way to understand the HTML structure of the standard classless template: https://workflowy.com/s/Q79FgxLKUT
* A [playground](http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/classless/playground.html) for testing themes:

  * use the almost-random HTML that is loaded, or click on the buttons to get real-world _classlessd_ HTML.
  * write the name of a theme in our [themes](https://github.com/fiatjaf/classless/tree/gh-pages/themes) directory to test it, or paste the URL of CSS theme (it can be from GitHub).
* A [showcase of the themes](http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/classless/showcase/) currently available at classless

## Is this being used somewhere?

* [my own website](http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/) uses a selected extract of the HTML structure described in [the standard](https://github.com/fiatjaf/classless/tree/gh-pages/template.html) and a custom personal simple theme (at [http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/site.css](http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/site.css)).
* Websites generated by [Websites for Trello](http://websitesfortrello.com/) comply to the HTML structure described in [classless.html](https://github.com/fiatjaf/classless/tree/gh-pages/classless.html) and suggests the themes in [themes](https://github.com/fiatjaf/classless/tree/gh-pages/themes) to its users, also allowing them to use their own (css and js only) themes.
* Trello cards published under http://cards.websitesfortrello.com/ use a small excerpt of [classless.html](https://github.com/fiatjaf/classless/tree/gh-pages/template.html) and the [Wardrobe theme](https://github.com/fiatjaf/classless/blob/gh-pages/themes/wardrobe.css).
